All of the code from Chapter 4 of Ethical Hacking: A Hands on Introduction to Breaking In. Chapter 4 is titled: Crafting TCP Shells and Botnets  


In this chapter, we are taught about sockets and process communication. It explains how TCP handshakes work the type/way packets are exchanged between the client and the server. We then are taught about what a TCP reverse shell is. It is explained that since a lot of firewalls allow outgoing connections only, the solution as an attacker is to install a reverse shell on the victim machine that connects to the command and control server outside the network. Once this connection is made, you can send commands to the victim which are then executed.  It then gives us a diagram that shows how this works/is going to work as we work in the chapter.
